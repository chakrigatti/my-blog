            <article>
            <p>At the start of this month, I challenged myself that I would post every week no matter how bad the essay was. One week, I used up an idea that I had been thinking about for more than a month. Another week, an interesting incident happened, and I wrote about connecting to it. Now I do not have anything to post. Nothing interesting happened this week to write about.</p>

            <p>So I asked ChatGPT about how to post every week without breaking the streak. It gave some links on how content creators post content frequently. They would have some ideas, and they will prepare them beforehand. So they will have a grace period if they do not have any content for that day or week. It makes sense to have some reserve of content to post so that we do not have to stress about the deadline.</p>

            <p>The above idea feels logical, but it won't work for me. The most I could do is note down ideas for essays and write something roughly about it. I work on the essays only on weekends. Writing one itself is taking many hours of effort.</p>

            <p>There are some ideas I want to share but they take time to develop. So I thought of a plan to post every week. Starting from next month, I will pick from one of my ideas or some technical topic to explain and work on it throughout the month. I will post it on a weekend nearer to the end of the month. Meanwhile, I will post every week about something interesting I found on the internet or something interesting I learned.</p>

            <p>Here is one such interesting website - <a href="https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html">If the moon were one pixel</a>.</p>
            <p>It shows a model of our solar system with an accurate representation of the size of planets and the distance between them. The concept is, if the moon is represented as one pixel on your screen, what would be the size of other celestial objects in our solar system? After scrolling through it, we will realize how empty our solar system is.</p>

            <p>Another interesting website I found is <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/archives/">Bartosz Ciechanowski</a>'s blog. He picks one topic and explains about them with good visualisations.</p>
