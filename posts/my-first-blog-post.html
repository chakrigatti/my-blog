            <article>
                <p>This is my first blog post, and I have been wanting to post this for a long time. I have read many
                    blogs in hacker news and read many posts describing how writing helps in many ways. Also, I liked
                    the idea of a personal website designed by me.</p>
                <h3>What do I expect from this blog?</h3>
                <p>I would like to write my opinions, experiences and things I learned. I want it to be mainly technical
                    . I am not sure about what content I should post here. I will figure it out as I go. For now, I will
                    just note down whatever I feel like is important. I think this could be the place where I can find
                    things I learned related to technology. Currently, I am learning CSS so that I could design the blog
                    myself according to the needs. I could summarise the tricks I used while learning some topic.</p>
                <h3>How do I want this blog in the future?</h3>
                <p>In future, I want this blog to have a slick design. I would also like to write some posts in my
                    mother tongue. So in future, it should have an option to switch between languages and translate the
                    post to a different language. Currently, it has only two views: one is the "Home" page and the other
                    is the post. I want to add more options like about page, my works, etc. I also want to add tags to
                    the posts. I have seen many small features in blogs like the time it will take to read the post,
                    back to top option, etc. It should be a continuous development, including everything I liked while I
                    came across reading other blog posts.</p>
                <h3>How will be the writing style?</h3>
                <p>It is hard to write a polished long post. We can easily dump our ideas onto paper, but it is hard to
                    organize the content in a manner that others can understand.</p>
                <p>Currently, I do not have any style, and it is a mess. I will improve it gradually. Currently I am
                    just writing the monologue in my head. I am just talking to myself and writing those thoughts here.
                </p>
                <h3>How frequent will your posts be?</h3>
                <p>This is the most difficult question in this post. One post a month will be too long, and I will
                    easily procrastinate and forget about this. One post a week is too short because I have to put a lot
                    of effort to get ideas about the posts and write about them in the short period of
                    time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, it is hard to write a polished post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>For now, I want to try writing one post per week and see how it goes. I will try to complete the post
                    on the weekend and post it.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I will start writing from now onwards and try to keep it up every week.</p>
