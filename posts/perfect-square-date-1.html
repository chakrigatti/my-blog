            <article>
<p>Last may, I had noticed a pattern in the date and I liked it very much immediately. The date was 05/05/25. The year was a perfect square of the day and the month. 
When I looked back for those perfect square dates, I found many other dates like that.  Even the gap between the square dates are in a odd number pattern.</p>
<p>
    3/3/9
    4/4/16 - Previous square date
    5/5/25 - Current square date
    6/6/36 - Next square date
    7/7/49
</p>
<p>
    After seeing the gap between two consecutive square dates it made me contemplate what I was doing on the previous square dates. 
</p>
<p>
    I will continue in part 2 about how my thinking process was on the previous square date. 
</p>
<p><em>PS : The last part of the essay was taking too much time to give a conclusion about what I was thinking, so I just split the easy one as part 1 .</em></p>
