            <article>
<p>Last May, I noticed a pattern in the date that immediately caught my attention. The date was 05/05/25. The year was the perfect square of the day and the month values.</p> 
<p>When I looked back for similar perfect square dates,I found many others,and even discovered the gaps between the square dates follow an odd number pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Perfect Square Date Pattern:</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>3/3/9</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ <em>7 years</em><br>
        <strong>4/4/16</strong> (Previous square date)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ <em>9 years</em><br>
        <strong>5/5/25</strong> (Current square date)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ <em>11 years</em><br>
        <strong>6/6/36</strong> (Next square date)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ <em>13 years</em><br>
        <strong>7/7/49</strong>
    </p>
    <p><em>The gaps between the square dates are: 7, 9, 11, 13...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
   After seeing the gaps between consecutive square dates, I began to contemplate what I was doing during those previous milestone dates.
</p>
<p>
    I will continue in Part 2 with my reflections and what I was doing on the previous square dates. 
</p>
<p><em>PS : The final section was taking too much time to write,so I decided to split this into parts.</em></p>
