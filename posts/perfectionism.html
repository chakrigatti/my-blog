            <article>
                <p>I wrote my first blog post on 22nd April. It took me more than two months to post this second one. In the <a href="https://chakrigatti.github.io/my-blog/posts/my-first-blog-post.html">First Blog post</a>, I concluded that I would post every weekend and that didn't happened. In the beginning , I was trying to design the perfect website where I could show code, math equations, and table of index for the headings of the post, etc.</p>
<p>I thought so much about what to post for the second one. I had many ideas, but I didn't feel like I could complete those in a week. I thought of writing an article on how to center a div in CSS. But researching itself took me more than a week.</p>
<p>Then I wanted my website to have a code viewer and its output. So I started developing for that. I thought the UI should be responsive for mobile also. So the task took even more time. The task took too much time and I lost my motivation to complete it. I started looking for an easier topic, and I couldn't find a smaller topic to post. So I started procrastinating in the pretext that it needed too much work. Like that, the initial weeks are gone and my motivation was also gone and I shelved the project and moved on to a different one.</p>
<p>When I was reading an <a href="https://maalvika.substack.com/p/being-too-ambitious-is-a-clever-form">article</a> from substack , it was describing exactly what I was experiencing. It mentions excellent points which I could relate to.</p>
<p>Here is one story from the article (the same story is in the book "Atomic Habits" also) that explains my situation very well :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a photography classroom at the University of Florida, Jerry Uelsmann unknowingly designed the perfect experiment for understanding excellence. He divided his students into two groups.</p>
<p>The quantity group would be graded on volume: one hundred photos for an A, ninety photos for a B, eighty photos for a C, and so on.</p>
<p>The quality group only need to present one perfect photo.</p>
<p>At semester's end, all the best photos came from the quantity group.</p>
<p>The quantity group learned something that cannot be taught: that excellence emerges from intimacy with imperfection, that mastery is built through befriending failure, and that the path to creating one perfect thing runs directly through creating many imperfect things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a perfect image of how my blog should be. I saw many cool blog designs, and I wanted all those features in my blog. But when I started working on it , I realized how much effort I needed to put to get that design and those features.</p>
<p>After my first post, I had many ideas for the blog post. But whenever I sat down to work on it , I couldn't finish the post because it didn't feel perfect to post it. So I didn't move forward with any of the ideas. After a month I moved to the next shiny new project.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://maalvika.substack.com/p/being-too-ambitious-is-a-clever-form">article</a> fully resonated with me and I want to start posting every week even if it is not perfect.</p>
<p><em>PS: I just gave a general title because I couldn't think of a good one.</em></p>
