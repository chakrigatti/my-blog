            <article>
               Have you ever felt after meeting someone new that this is a very small world and we are very close than we imagine?
The main concept of six degrees of separation is that we can make a connection to any person on earth through our acquaintances and their acquaintances. 
All the persons you know are connected to you by one degree of separation. The friend of your friend is connected to you by two degrees of separation. This theory claims that we can connect to any random person on this planet with at most six degrees of separation.
For example, there are at most six people standing between you and our Prime Minister or some famous person.
Imagine you have 45 acquaintances, and those acquaintances have 45 unique acquaintances. and so on. If you go like that till the 6th level depth, then you will have 45 power 6 people i.e. 8.3 Billion people which is more than the people alive currently (8.2 Billion).  
Actually, six degree separation is the worst case scenario. Most of the cases, we can easily make connections with 3 to 4 degrees of separation if they are close to you or work in the same company or in the same country.
Using this concept, I could say that I am connected to our Prime minister Modi Ji with just two degrees of separation through my company CEO. All my friends could say they are connected by three degrees of separation. 
I took on the challenge of talking to strangers who are sitting beside me during my commute to the office. So I started  a conversation thinking he would be a complete stranger. To my surprise, he is roommates with one of my recently acquainted friends from the office.This concept is often used to convey how small our world is even if we are separated by oceans and continents.  




Many mathematicians conducted experiments to prove this. In 2008, Microsoft analyzed its public messenger database to find out the minimum chain length it would take to connect 180 billion different pairs of users. According to the findings, the average chain length is 6.6.  
In 2016, researches at Facebook reported that the chain length between the facebook users reduced to an average of 3.5 degrees of separation. 
There are even games with a concept similar to this. One game was to connect two random words. You can go from one word to another using some similarity or connection between them. Using those connections you have to reach the target word. You will get more points if you can reach the target word with less connection words. The website which hosted this game made some research on the number words it took to reach the target word, it averaged around 6.6 words.
Another game is to start from one Wikipedia article and reach to another one using the links present in the article.
The six degree of separation is the best case that is present in all the paths that connect to a person. Also, just because you are easily connected doesn't mean it will be a meaningful connection. Even though you are just three degrees separated from some company CEO, you can't get a referral from him. The degree of separation doesn't mention anything about the strength of the connection. They could be just week ties.
