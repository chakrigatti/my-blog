            <article>
                <p>Have you ever felt after meeting someone new that this is a very small world and we are very close than we imagine?</p>
                
                <p>The main concept of six degrees of separation is that we can make a connection to any person on earth through our acquaintances and their acquaintances. All the persons you know are connected to you by one degree of separation. The friend of your friend is connected to you by two degrees of separation. This theory claims that we can connect to any random person on this planet with at most six degrees of separation.</p>
                
                <p>For example, there are at most six people standing between you and our Prime Minister or some famous person.</p>
                
                <p>Imagine you have 45 acquaintances, and those acquaintances have 45 unique acquaintances, and so on. If you go like that till the 6th level depth, then you will have 45<sup>6</sup> people — that's <strong>8.3 billion people</strong>, which is more than the people alive currently (8.2 billion).</p>
                
                <p>Actually, six degrees of separation is the <em>worst case scenario</em>. Most of the time, we can easily make connections with 3 to 4 degrees of separation if they are close to you or work in the same company or in the same country.</p>
                
                <p>Using this concept, I could say that I am connected to our Prime minister Modi Ji with just two degrees of separation through my company CEO. All my friends could say they are connected by three degrees of separation.</p>
                
                <p>I took on the challenge of talking to strangers who are sitting beside me during my commute to the office. So I started a conversation thinking he would be a complete stranger. To my surprise, he is roommates with one of my recently acquainted friends from the office. This concept is often used to convey how small our world is even if we are separated by oceans and continents.</p>
                
                <h2>Research and Evidence</h2>
                
                <p>Many mathematicians conducted experiments to prove this. In <strong>2008</strong>, Microsoft analyzed its public messenger database to find out the minimum chain length it would take to connect 180 billion different pairs of users. According to the findings, the average chain length is <strong>6.6</strong>.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>
                
                <p>In <strong>2016</strong>, researchers at Facebook reported that the chain length between Facebook users reduced to an average of just <strong>3.5 degrees of separation</strong>.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>
                
                <h2>Games and Applications</h2>
                
                <p>There are even games with a concept similar to this:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Word Connection Game:</strong> Connect two random words using similarity or connections between them. You get more points if you reach the target word with fewer connection words. Research on this game showed it averaged around <strong>6.6 words</strong>.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></li>
                    <li><strong>Wikipedia Game:</strong> Start from one Wikipedia article and reach another using only the links present in each article.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Limitations and Reality</h2>
                
                <p>Six degrees of separation represents the <em>shortest possible path</em> that connects to a person. However, just because you are easily connected doesn't mean it will be a meaningful connection. Even though you are just three degrees separated from some company CEO, you can't necessarily get a referral from them. The degree of separation doesn't mention anything about the <strong>strength of the connection</strong> — they could be just weak ties.</p>
            
                <p>The concept of six degrees of separation reminds us that despite living in a world of billions, we're all more interconnected than we realize. Whether it's bumping into a stranger on the commute who turns out to be connected to your social circle, or knowing that a few introductions could theoretically connect you to anyone on the planet, this theory highlights the beautiful complexity of human networks. While the strength of these connections may vary, the mere possibility of such connections existing makes our world feel both vast and intimate at the same time.</p>
